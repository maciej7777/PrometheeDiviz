# PrometheeDiviz

Introduces new Promethee modules for Diviz system.

## Introduction
The main idea of the project is to provide a wide range of programs that enable user to perform calculations using Promethee methods. To do this we divided most common methods into several steps (like calculation of flows, calculation of final ranking/classification, SRF-based weights calculations and some visualizations approaches) and created highly parametrized modules that enable user even to create his own Promethee method! The project is run in 4 repositories, which are:
- https://github.com/maciej7777/PrometheeDiviz
- https://github.com/Yamadads/PrometheeDiviz
- https://github.com/MagdalenaDziecielska/PrometheeDiviz
- https://github.com/dohko93/mcdm

All the programs are available to use on the diviz platform. 

## Implemented methods
In this repository there are presented 7 modules, which are following:
- PROMETHEE-FlowSort-GDSS_assignments - the module prepared for calculating Flowsort GDSS assignments.
- PROMETHEE-I-FlowSort_assignments - the module prepared for calculating Flowsort I assignments.
- PROMETHEE-II-FlowSort_assignments - the module prepared for calculating Flowsort II assignments.
- PROMETHEE-PROMSORT_assignments - the module prepared for calculating Promsort assignments.
- PROMETHEE-TRI_assignments - the module prepared for calculating Promethee TRI assignments.
- plotClassAssignments-LaTeX - the module prepared for generating latex table with the result assignements.
- plotClassAssignments-png - the module prepared for visualization of the final assignements.

## Diviz
Diviz is an open source tool for creating and executing algorithms from predefined modlues. You can find more about the project at:
