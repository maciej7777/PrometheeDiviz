# PrometheeDiviz

Introduces new Promethee modules for Diviz system.

## Introduction
The main idea of the project is to provide a wide range of programs that enable user to perform calculations using Promethee methods. To do this we divided most common methods into several steps (like calculation of flows, calculation of final ranking/classification, SRF-based weights calculations and some visualizations approaches) and created highly parametrized modules that enable user even to create his own Promethee method! The project is run in 4 repositories, which are:
- https://github.com/maciej7777/PrometheeDiviz
- https://github.com/Yamadads/PrometheeDiviz
- https://github.com/MagdalenaDziecielska/PrometheeDiviz
- https://github.com/dohko93/mcdm
