1. Libraries
- XMCDA - to compile and run each module you need to provide to project XMCDA library which supports xml files with tags 2.2.2 and 3.0.2 
or above. It need to support at leat conversion of tags alternativesAssignments (v3) and alternativesAffectations (v2) - as it is the 
last change in library required by this project.

2. Java version
To run modules from the repository you need to provide JAVA version at least 1.8 as some modules uses lambda expresions.

3. Build and run modules
The easiest way to build and run all modules from the repository is to import them using Intellij IDE. While running module you need to 
specify main class (in each module it is the one with "CLI" in the name) and version of xmcda library and inputs and outputs files like 
in following example:

--v3 -i tests/in6.v3 -o tests/out6.v3

Where:
- "--v3" means that we are using xmcda v3 standard
- "-i tests/in6.v3" informs us that we are using files from folder tests/in6.v3 as input; "-i" stands for input
- "-o tests/out6.v3" informs us that we are using files from folder tests/out6.v3 as output; "-o" stands for output
